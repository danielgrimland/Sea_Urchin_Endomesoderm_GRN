# Endomesoderm GRN Modeling Using RE:IN in Purple Sea Urchins

Daniel Grimland, Eitan Tannebaum

## Project Description

This scientific research project aims to model gene expression in the stem cells of the Purple Sea Urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) in the endomesoderm area of the embryo. This is done by computational modeling using a methodology called Reasoning Engine: Interaction Networks, or RE:IN. The biological system modeled, the Gene Regulatory Network (GRN), captures gene expression processes across different cells. By modeling and analyzing the cell fate of stem cells in the endomesoderm, we seek to gain insights into the development of creatures, understand the architecture of the endomesoderm GRN, and improve current models of it.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to unravel the complex mechanisms governing stem cell fate determination in the endomesoderm of Purple Sea Urchins. By modeling the gene expressions within the GRN, we can investigate the molecular interactions and regulatory processes involved. This research has the potential to advance our understanding of developmental biology and contribute to the improvement of computational models in this field.

## Problem Statement

The problem we aim to solve is the accurate modeling of stem cell gene expressions in the Purple Sea Urchin endomesoderm GRN. This is done in great part by combining existing research and models with mathematical analysis tools to construct and robustly check models.

## Key Features

This research project incorporates the following key features:

### ABN Synthesis

We translate data on the system components of the endomesoderm GRN into RE:IN abstract boolean networks (ABNs). ABNs provide a simplified representation of system components, the nature of gene regulatory interactions, and the essential dynamics of the system.

#### Experimental Constraints Synthesis

Experimental data is translated from a single file detailing the expression details of system components to RE:IN experimental constraints. This transformation allows the efficient selection of constraints and experiments to be output, as well as the addition of flexible constraints.

### Efficient Combination of Constraints and ABNs

We develop an efficient methodology to combine abstract boolean networks with experimental constraints, resulting in constrained abstract boolean networks (cABNs). This quick integration allows quick testing of constraints with ABNs.
