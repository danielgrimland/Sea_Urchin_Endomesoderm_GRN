# Endomesoderm GRN Modeling Using RE:IN in Purple Sea Urchins

Authors: Daniel Grimland, Eitan Tannebaum, Hillel Kugler

## Project Description

This scientific research project aims to model gene expression of stem cells of the Purple Sea Urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) in the endomesoderm area of the embryo. This is done by computational modeling using a methodology called Reasoning Engine: Interaction Networks, or RE:IN. The biological system modeled, the Gene Regulatory Network (GRN), captures gene expression processes across different cells. By modeling and alayzing cell fate of stem cells in the endomesoderm, we seek to gain insights into the development of creatures, understand the architecture of the endomesoderm GRN, and improve current models of it.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to unravel the complex mechanisms governing stem cell fate determination in the endomesoderm of Purple Sea Urchins. By modeling the gene expressions within the GRN, we can investigate the molecular interactions and regulatory processes involved. This research has the potential to advance our understanding of developmental biology and contribute to the improvement of computational models in this field.

## Problem Statement

The problem we aim to solve is the accurate modeling of stem cell gene expressions in the Purple Sea Urchin endomesoderm GRN. This is done in great part by the combiniation of existing research and models with mathematical analysis tools to construct and robustly check models.

## Key Features

This research project incorporates the following key features:

### ABN Synthesis

Abstract Boolean Networks (ABNs): We translate data on the system components of the endomesoderm GRN into abstract boolean networks. ABNs provide a simplified representation of gene regulatory interactions, capturing the essential dynamics of the system.

### Experimental Constraints Synthesis

Experimental Data Translation: Experimental data is translated into constraints for the model. By incorporating real-world observations, we enhance the accuracy and reliability of the modeled GRN.

### Efficient Combination of Constraints and ABNs

Efficient Combination of ABNs and Constraints: We develop an efficient methodology to combine the abstract boolean networks with experimental constraints, resulting in constrained abstract boolean networks (cABNs). This integration allows us to refine the model and align it with the observed behavior of the Purple Sea Urchin endomesoderm GRN.
