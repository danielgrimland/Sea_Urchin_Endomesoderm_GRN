Purpose and Usage:
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The Cytoscape Model Generator takes a RE:IN cABN and visualizes it using Cytoscape. The resultant model defines
partitions of the edges and nodes into groups according to the needs of the user and to allow sylizing each according to the
user's intent.

To use it, simply provide the path and name of a .rein file and specify groups of components if you desire (if you do such, make sure
the components in your file have names which end with their groups, such as: protien_groupA).
